### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm Andrew, a university student at the Australian National University (ANU) studying a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. I have a passion for coding, problem-solving, web-development, and learning about the intersection of technology and mathematics.

## Projects

Here you'll find a collection of projects that I've worked on, ranging from personal experiments to class assignments. I upload projects that I deem worthy to share, serving both as a portfolio of my work and as a motivation to keep exploring and creating in my free time.

Feel free to explore my repositories and provide feedback or suggestions. I'm always open to collaboration and learning from others!
